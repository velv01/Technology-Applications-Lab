## Using Arduino IDE

In the Arduino IDE, the standard programming model is based on the "setup" and "loop" functions, which do not inherently support real-time multitasking. However, you can still achieve some level of multitasking and time-sensitive operations by using cooperative multitasking techniques or external libraries specifically designed for task scheduling.

One popular library for task scheduling in the Arduino environment is the "Arduino TaskScheduler" library. It provides a simple way to schedule and execute tasks at specific intervals or based on events. You can use this library to create tasks that read sensor data from the MPU6050 and perform other operations concurrently.

Here's an example of how you can use the TaskScheduler library to interface the MPU6050 with the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE:

1. Install the TaskScheduler Library:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries".
   - Search for "TaskScheduler" and install the "TaskScheduler" library by "Bret Stateham".

2. Wiring Connections:
   - Connect the MPU6050 to the ESP32 following the wiring connections mentioned in the previous responses.

3. Implement the Code:
   - Open a new sketch in the Arduino IDE.
   - Copy and paste the following code:

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <MPU6050.h>
#include <TaskScheduler.h>

TaskScheduler taskScheduler;

MPU6050 mpu;

void readSensorData()
{
  int16_t ax, ay, az;
  int16_t gx, gy, gz;
  
  mpu.getMotion6(&ax, &ay, &az, &gx, &gy, &gz);
  
  // Process the sensor data as needed
  
  Serial.print("Accelerometer: ");
  Serial.print("X = "); Serial.print(ax);
  Serial.print(" Y = "); Serial.print(ay);
  Serial.print(" Z = "); Serial.println(az);
  
  Serial.print("Gyroscope: ");
  Serial.print("X = "); Serial.print(gx);
  Serial.print(" Y = "); Serial.print(gy);
  Serial.print(" Z = "); Serial.println(gz);
}

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin();
  
  mpu.initialize();
  
  taskScheduler.init();
  taskScheduler.addTask(readSensorData);
  
  Serial.println("MPU6050 Connection Successful");
}

void loop() {
  taskScheduler.execute();
}
```

4. Select the Board and Port:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" -> "Board" and select your ESP32 board.
   - Go to "Tools" -> "Port" and select the COM port to which the ESP32 is connected.

5. Upload and Run:
   - Click the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to upload the code to the ESP32.
   - Open the serial monitor by going to "Tools" -> "Serial Monitor" to see the MPU6050 sensor data.

The code uses the TaskScheduler library to create a task called `readSensorData` that reads the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the MPU6050 sensor. The `setup` function initializes the MPU6050, sets up the task scheduler, and adds the `readSensorData` task to be executed at regular intervals. The `loop` function continuously executes the task scheduler.

Please note that while this approach allows for concurrent execution of tasks, it does not provide the same level of real-time guarantees as a full-fledged RTOS. It relies on cooperative multitasking and is subject to the limitations of the Arduino programming model. If you require more precise timing or more complex task scheduling, using a full RTOS framework like ESP-IDF or a more powerful development environment such as PlatformIO with FreeRTOS may be more suitable.


===========================================
## Using PlatformIO IDE

To interface the MPU6050 sensor with ESP32 using PlatformIO IDE and the ESP-IDF framework, you can follow these steps:

1. Install PlatformIO:
   - Download and install the PlatformIO IDE from the official website (https://platformio.org/platformio-ide).
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. Create a New Project:
   - Open PlatformIO IDE.
   - Click on "New Project" or go to "PlatformIO" -> "New Project".
   - Choose a directory for your project and select "ESP32" as the development board.
   - Select a framework as "ESP-IDF".
   - Click on "Finish" to create the project.

3. Configure Project Settings:
   - Open the `platformio.ini` file in the root of your project.
   - Add the following lines to the file to configure the framework and libraries:

     ```ini
     [env:esp32]
     platform = espressif32
     framework = espidf
     lib_deps =
         Wire
         MPU6050
     ```

4. Implement the Code:
   - Create a new source file (e.g., `main.c` or `main.cpp`) in the `src` directory of your project.
   - Copy and paste the following code into the source file:

     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <freertos/FreeRTOS.h>
     #include <freertos/task.h>
     #include <driver/i2c.h>
     #include <esp_log.h>
     #include <mpu6050.h>

     static const char* TAG = "MPU6050";

     void mpu6050_task(void *pvParameters)
     {
         MPU6050 mpu;
         mpu6050_init(&mpu, I2C_NUM_0);

         while (1)
         {
             float ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz;
             
             mpu6050_read_accel(&mpu, &ax, &ay, &az);
             mpu6050_read_gyro(&mpu, &gx, &gy, &gz);

             ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Accelerometer: X=%.2f Y=%.2f Z=%.2f", ax, ay, az);
             ESP_LOGI(TAG, "Gyroscope: X=%.2f Y=%.2f Z=%.2f", gx, gy, gz);

             vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));  // Delay for 1 second
         }
     }

     void app_main()
     {
         xTaskCreate(mpu6050_task, "mpu6050_task", 4096, NULL, 5, NULL);
     }
     ```

5. Build and Upload:
   - Connect your ESP32 board to your computer.
   - Click on the "Build" icon in PlatformIO IDE to compile the project.
   - Click on the "Upload" icon to upload the firmware to the ESP32.

The code initializes the MPU6050 sensor, creates a task `mpu6050_task` that reads the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the sensor, and logs the data using `ESP_LOGI`. The task runs in a loop with a delay of 1 second between readings. You can modify the code to suit your specific requirements and perform additional processing on the sensor data.


============================================
## Using ESP-IDF Framework

To interface the MPU6050 sensor with the ESP32 microcontroller using a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the ESP32 RTOS Development Environment:
   - Install ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) following the instructions provided by Espressif Systems.
   - Set up the ESP32 toolchain and configure the necessary environment variables.

2. Create a New Project:
   - Use the ESP-IDF command-line tools or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO extension to create a new ESP32 project.
   - Configure the project using the `menuconfig` command to set up the necessary RTOS configurations, such as stack size, task priorities, etc.

3. Include Required Libraries:
   - In your project's `main.c` or `app_main.c` file, include the required ESP-IDF libraries for I2C communication and RTOS functionality:
     ```c
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <freertos/FreeRTOS.h>
     #include <freertos/task.h>
     #include <driver/i2c.h>
     #include <esp_log.h>
     #include <mpu6050.h>
     ```

4. Define I2C Parameters:
   - Define the I2C bus number and the SDA/SCL pins for the MPU6050:
     ```c
     #define I2C_MASTER_NUM I2C_NUM_0
     #define I2C_MASTER_SDA_IO 21
     #define I2C_MASTER_SCL_IO 22
     #define I2C_MASTER_FREQ_HZ 100000
     ```

5. Initialize I2C Communication:
   - In the `app_main` function, initialize the I2C communication and configure the I2C bus parameters:
     ```c
     i2c_config_t conf;
     conf.mode = I2C_MODE_MASTER;
     conf.sda_io_num = I2C_MASTER_SDA_IO;
     conf.sda_pullup_en = GPIO_PULLUP_ENABLE;
     conf.scl_io_num = I2C_MASTER_SCL_IO;
     conf.scl_pullup_en = GPIO_PULLUP_ENABLE;
     conf.master.clk_speed = I2C_MASTER_FREQ_HZ;
     i2c_param_config(I2C_MASTER_NUM, &conf);
     i2c_driver_install(I2C_MASTER_NUM, conf.mode, 0, 0, 0);
     ```

6. Implement the MPU6050 Task:
   - Create a new task to handle the MPU6050 sensor data retrieval:
     ```c
     void mpu6050_task(void *pvParameters)
     {
         MPU6050 mpu6050;
         mpu6050_init(&mpu6050, I2C_MASTER_NUM);
         
         while (1)
         {
             float ax, ay, az, gx, gy, gz;
             
             mpu6050_read_accel(&mpu6050, &ax, &ay, &az);
             mpu6050_read_gyro(&mpu6050, &gx, &gy, &gz);
             
             // Process the sensor data as needed
             
             vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));  // Delay for 1 second
         }
     }
     ```

7. Start the RTOS Scheduler:
   - In the `app_main` function, create and start the MPU6050 task, and then start the RTOS scheduler:
     ```c
     void app_main()
     {
         xTaskCreate(mpu6050_task, "mpu6050_task", 4096, NULL, 5, NULL);
         vTaskStartScheduler();
     }
     ```

8. Build and Flash:
   - Use the ESP-IDF command-line tools or your preferred IDE to build and flash the firmware to the ESP32.

The code above initializes the I2C communication, creates an RTOS task that reads data from the MPU6050 sensor, and processes it as required. The task runs in a loop, reading the accelerometer and gyroscope data at regular intervals. You can modify the code to perform further processing or send the data to other modules as per your specific application requirements.

Note: The code provided is a basic template and may require additional error handling, calibration, and configuration based on the MPU6050 library you choose to use. Make sure to include the appropriate MPU6050 library and modify the code accordingly.
