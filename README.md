# Technology-Applications-Lab
Apply electronics and communication technology to solve real-world problems from your own perspective and with an end-to-end case-study based approach blended with emerging technology of machine learning.



## Lab Exercises
1. Orientation of the problem statement and its application in the real world.
2. Understand working of accelerometer sensors. Read datasheet and note the important
   aspects associated with the sensors.
3. Interface accelerometer sensors hardware to processor. Choose the appropriate on-board
   communication standards eg. UART, I2C, SPI, One wire and so on.
4. Design and implement a real-time application on Real-Time Operating System to collect
   accelerometer sensor data
5. Choose appropriate communication technology to send sensor data to gateway based on
   Embedded Linux and store in the database
6. Apply appropriate data cleaning techniques (remove duplicates, correct errors, deal with
   missing values, normalization, data type conversions, etc.)
7. Visualize data to help detect relevant relationships between variables and perform other
   exploratory analysis
8. Choose appropriate machine learning models, train the models, evaluate them for
   performance metrics and perform predictions
9. Demonstrate end to end working of the system in real time
